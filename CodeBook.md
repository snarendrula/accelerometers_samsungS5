Here are the different attributes provided in the source raw data for each code:
- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Steps followed to get to the tidy data:
1. Download the source data from the link provided in README.md
2. change your working directory to point to the downloaded location. 
3. Read data from test and train folders
4. Identify the variables that are required for the output. 
5. In this excercise we need to report mean and standard devaiation for different signals from the smart phone. 
6. Merge two data sets test and train, assign column names from
